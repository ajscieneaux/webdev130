                    <p>Hot air ballooning is a fun and amazing sport. Many fly for fun, some pilots fly 
                        for personal business giving rides and such. Some pilots fly for filming crews
                    because the smoothness of flight makes an smooth and steady platform for the filming
                    process.  </p>

                    <h3> Ballooning Equipment</h3>
                    <!-- <div class="right">1</div> -->

                    <p> Important parts of a hot air balloon include the basket, envelope, burner, fuel tanks, 
                        rip line, drop line.
                        Other items that are also important include hauling trailer, basket cover, safety 
                        helments, radios, and snacks! Please keep in mind that special insurance is also needed
                        for hot air balloon pilots.  It is considered a high risk activity and there are only 
                        a few companies in the US that will actually offer insurance for hot air balloons and
                        ballooing activities.
