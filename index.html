        <p> Hello there! My name is Amy.  I used to fly hot air balloons. 
            In the picture above, I am the person on the right. I have taken my younger sister
            in the middle on a balloon ride before. The person on the right is my older
            sister. We all do a lot together and enjoy each other's company.
            I am building this page to share some of the things I like about ballooning</p>

          <li>Tethered rides on a hot air balloon cause more stress on the balloon than free flight.</li>

      <p>Texas is great - even with it's hot summer months. I miss the Utah and Idaho
        snow at Christmas, and I miss the cool summer nights, but I love being with my 
        family and feel like Texas is home. Texas is the largest state in the lower 48 states.
        It is bordered by Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. It also shares a 
        border with Mexico. It has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico as well. The state capital
        is Austin. Several other states could fit within the state of Texas and still have
        room left over.
