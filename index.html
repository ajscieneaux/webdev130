        <img src="images/balloon0768.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Amy" width ="200">
        <p> Hello there! My name is Amy.  I used to fly hot air balloons. 
            In the picture to the right, I am the person on the left. On right is my younger sister. <br>
            I took my sister for a ride in my hot air balloon when I lived in Utah. 
            She is afraid of heights so it was quite a challenge for her to come with me.
            We had a great time though.<br><br>
            I am building this page to share information about hot air balloing and 
            some of the things I like about ballooning.</p><br>
        <!-- add an unordered list as part of w3 task -->
        <p style="color: #042a13; font-weight: bolder;"> A few things you may not know: </p>
        <ul class="ulstyle1">
          <li>To have the least amount of unexpected air disturbance balloons fly in early morning or late evening.</li>
          <li>Tethered rides on a hot air balloon cause more stress on the balloon than free flight.</li>
          <li>Flying a hot air balloon is a lot of work, but is also a lot of fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- decided to keep above list and add ballooning site links as well. page references open in a new window -->
         <p style="font-size: 16px; color: blue;"> If you are interesting in taking a hot air balloon flight, check out these websites:</p>

      <h2>Utah/Texas/Idaho</h2>
      <img src="images/states.png" alt="state picture" width="200">
      <p>Texas is great - even with it's hot summer months. I miss the Utah and Idaho
        snow at Christmas, and I miss the cool summer nights, but I love being with my 
        family and feel like Texas is home. Texas is the largest state in the lower 48 states.
        It is bordered by Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. It also shares a 
        border with Mexico. It has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico as well. The state capital
        is Austin. Several other states could fit within the state of Texas and still have
        room left over.
